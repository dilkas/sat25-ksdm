FastWFOMC is a tool for computing the weighted first-order model count (WFOMC) of a two-variable sentence in a domain-lifted way. See our paper:

Timothy van Bremen and Ondrej Kuzelka. "Faster Lifting for Two-Variable Logic Using Cell Graphs". UAI 2021.

for details on the techniques used.

To run FastWFOMC, you will first need to make a copy of the d-DNNF compiler DSharp available at "bin/dsharp". Once you have done this, you can try running:

main.py n

to compute the number of 4-coloured graphs on n nodes (OEIS sequence A223887). You can also try changing the example in main.py to a different two-variable sentence.

Some code snippets have been borrowed and modified from elsewhere; in particular:

- ddnnf.py contains code for d-DNNF parsing/evaluation that roughly follows WAPS (https://github.com/meelgroup/WAPS)
- translator.py contains code modified from http://www.sista.arizona.edu/~clayton/courses/ai/projects/wumpus/docs/minisat.html
